REQUIREMENTS
------------
This version of Boost is designed for Drupal 4.7 running on a Unix platform.
Drupal's clean URLs MUST be enabled and working properly.

The `path' and `pathauto' modules are recommended.

In order for the static files to be correctly expired, the Drupal cron job
must be correctly setup to execute more often than, or as often as, the
cache lifetime interval you specify.

Since the static page caching is implemented with mod_rewrite directives,
Apache version 1.3 or 2.x with mod_rewrite enabled is required (if Drupal's
clean URLs work for you, you're fine; if not, get them working first).
Other web servers, such as Lighttpd, are NOT supported at present.

The `drush' module is required for (optional) command line usage.

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> Clean URLs and ensure that
   Drupal's clean URLs are enabled and working properly on your site.

2. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called modules/boost/
   under your Drupal installation directory.

3. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Modules and enable the Boost module.

4. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance >> Boost to review
   and change the module's configuration options to your liking.

5. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> Performance, specify the cache
   directory (must be writable by the web server) and enable static caching.

6. Log out from Drupal (or use another browser) and browse around your site
   as the anonymous user. Ensure that static files are indeed being
   generated into the Boost cache directory you specified above.

7. IMPORTANT: replace your .htaccess file in the Drupal installation
   directory with the file from modules/boost/htaccess/boosted.txt,
   customizing the mod_rewrite rules to your particular setup if needed.
   (If you fail to do this, static page caching will NOT work!)

8. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)
