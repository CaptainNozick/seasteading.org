UPGRADING
---------

WARNING: If you upgraded from Google Analytics 1.3 or before you must
check your "Role specific tracking settings" settings at
admin/settings/googleanalytics. If not set properly Google Analytics
may begin tracking different pages than you intended after upgrading.

Beginning with Google Analytics 1.4 the logic for when to include the
Google Analytics code on a page has been reversed. In 1.3 and before,
roles were checked in checkboxes to exclude Google Analytics from
counting pages when users with those roles were logged in. Beginning
with 1.4 those same checkboxes are used to include the tracking code
only on pages for the roles checked.

Beginning with 1.5, if no boxes are checked, the code will be placed on
all pages. With version 1.5 the visibility settings have designed to
mirror Drupal's block visibility settings.


Note that with Google Analytics 1.4 you are not able to track pages for
authenticated users who have no specific role set and also exclude
other authenticated users who do have a specific role. Clicking on the
"authenticated user" role checkbox will automatically cause the tracking
code to be written for all logged in users.

Beginning with Google Analytics 1.5 admins with permission can include
custom php to get the precise tracking they desire that might not be
possible with the available configuration settings.
