INTRODUCTION
------------
Advanced Forum (http://drupal.org/project/advanced_forum) enhances Drupal's forum module to provide the look and, with the help of other modules, much of the functionality found in common forum software. Because it uses the core forum module, it uses the node and comment system built into Drupal and is completely integrated, not a bridge.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Copy the entire advanced_forum project directory (not just the contents) to your normal 
   module directory (ie: sites/all/modules)

2. Enable the advanced forum module at ?q=admin/build/modules

3. Visit the Advanced Forum settings page at ?q=admin/settings/advanced-forum 
   * "Advanced forum style directory" Enter the name of the style you are using. 
     See http://drupal.org/node/234042 for more information on this.
   * "Treat all site comments like forum comments" If you would like advanced forum to take 
   over the theming of all comments, even those outside the forum, choose yes here.

4. In the module package is a directory called "styles". Choose the style to use and 
   directory (not just the contents) to your theme's directory. If you use more than one 
   theme with forums, copy it to each theme's directory. If you use subthemes, copy it there.

5. If you are not using a theme with built in AF support (Zen, some Roople themes, 
   possibly others) Add this code to the top of _phptemplate_variables in template.php 
   in your theme and make sure you are returning $vars, not array() at the end:

  if (module_exists('advanced_forum')) {
    $vars = advanced_forum_addvars($hook, $vars);
  }

  This assumes a basic knowledge of PHP to be able to do any merging necessary. If you 
  don't know how to do this, see http://drupal.org/node/207841.
   
OTHER CONFIGURATION
-------------------
   
1. Forum settings ( ?q=admin/content/forum/settings ) 
    * Hot topic threshold: Up to you.
    * Topics per page: Up to you.
    * Default order: "Date - newest first" so the most recent posts are at the top of the 
      topic list.
2. Comment settings ( ?q=admin/content/comment/settings ) 
    * Set Default display mode: Flat list - expanded. (Advforum is intended to be used flat. 
      Using it threaded should mostly work but is unsupported and may have some issues.) 
    * Default display order: Date - oldest first 
    * Default comments per page: Up to you. (If you chose to have a threaded forum, 
      setting this number to the maximum will reduce issues with pagination and threading.) 
    * Comment controls: "Do not display" is recommended.
    * Anonymous commenting: Up to you.
    * Comment subject field: Up to you. If disabled, advforum will not display the Drupal 
      default subject, which is the first few words of the comment.
    * Preview comment: Up to you.
    * Location of comment submission form: Up to you. Displaying below provides a non-ajax quick reply.
5. User settings ( ?q=admin/user/settings ) 
   * Signature support: Enabled
   * Picture support: Enable this for avatars in the forum.
   * Picture maximum dimensions: If you change this from the default 85x85, you will want 
     to size it in either CSS or with imagecache to avoid breaking the forum layout.
6. Statistics settings ( ?q=admin/reports/settings ) 
   * Make sure the statistics module is enabled.
   * Enable access log: Enabled
   * Count content views: Enabled - Needed for topic views count.

Advanced forum was originally based on flatforum. Though there is little or no code left
from that module, its authors deserve credit for the idea.

The Naked style was created by stephthegeek (http://drupal.org/user/47874). Previous 
theme work was done by eigentor (http://drupal.org/user/96718) and jacine
