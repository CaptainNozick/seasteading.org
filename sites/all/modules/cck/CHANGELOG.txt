5--1.6-1
========

Hotfix release for CCK 1.6.

Bugfix
------

General
- #167607  Fix '&nbsp' (missing ';') on field display.

Field / widget modules
- #167468  Nodereference : Fixed autocomplete widget w/ 'advanced (Views) mode' and Views 1.6 :

5--1.6
======

IMPORTANT : this release fixes two cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities 
in nodereference.module :
- when a nodereference field is displayed using the 'plain' formatter
- when a nodereference field is edited using the 'autocomplete text field' widget

All sites using CCK / nodereference.module should consider upgrading to this release
as soon as possible.
