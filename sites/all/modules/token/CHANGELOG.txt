2007-September-2:
[comment-author-name] is now filtered.  Also provided additional -raw tokens
  for any tokens which are checked.  As their help text suggests, these are 
  potentially dangerous: "WARNING - raw user input."  Only use these if you really
  know that you need to use them because they may contain malicious code.

2007-August-15:
[menupath] token no longer includes the top level.  If you need the previous 
	   behavior please use [menu][menupath] to get the same effect.

Before 2007-August-15
Lots of stuff happened before we had a CHANGELOG.txt.
