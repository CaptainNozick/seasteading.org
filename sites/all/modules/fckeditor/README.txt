Overview
--------
This module allows Drupal to replace textarea fields with the
FCKeditor.
This HTML text editor brings many of the powerful functions of known
desktop editors like Word to the web. It's relatively lightweight and
doesn't require any kind of installation on the client computer.

Required components
-------------------
To use FCKeditor in Drupal, you will need to download the FCKeditor
http://www.fckeditor.net/

Requirements
------------
  - Drupal 5.x
  - PHP 4.3.0 or greater
  - FCKeditor 2.3.x or greater (http://www.fckeditor.net/)

Configuration
-------------------
   1. Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
   2. Grant permissions for use of FCKeditor in Administer > User Management > Access Control
   3. Under Administer > Settings > FCKeditor, create the fckeditor profiles. 
      In each profile you can choose which textareas will be replaced by FCKeditor, 
      select default toolbar and configure some more advanced settings
   4. For the Rich Text Editing to work you also need to configure your filters for the users that may access Rich Text Editing. 
      Either grant those users Full HTML access or use the following:
      <a> <p> <span> <div> <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> <img> <map> <area> <hr> 
      <br> <br /> <ul> <ol> <li> <dl> <dt> <dd> <table> <tr> <td> <em> <b> <u> <i> <strong> 
      <font> <del> <ins> <sub> <sup> <quote> <blockquote> <pre> <address> <code> 
      <cite> <embed> <object> <strike> <caption>.
   5. To have a better control over line breaks, you may disable Line break converter in the chosen filter (recommended).
   6. Modify the fckeditor.config.js file to custom your needs (optional).
      You may copy the needed configuration lines from the default FCKeditor configuration settings (modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/fckconfig.js), 
      the lines in fckeditor.config.js will override most settings.

Installation troubleshooting
----------------------------
If your FCKeditor does not show you must check if all files are extracted correctly. 
The directory /drupal5b/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/ should have the following files:
fckeditor.js, fckconfig.js, fckstyles.xml, fcktemplates.xml and a directory named editor.
The correct directory structure is as follows:

    modules
       fckeditor
          fckeditor.module
          fckeditor
             _samples
             editor
             COPY_HERE.txt
             fckconfig.js
             ...

Plugins: Teaser break and Pagebreak
-----------------------------------
By default, FCKeditor module comes with two plugins that can handle teaser break (<!--break-->) and pagebreak (<!--pagebreak-->). 
You can enable any (or even both) of them.

   1. Open /drupal5b/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor.config.js and uncomment these three lines:

            FCKConfig.PluginsPath = '../../plugins/' ;
            FCKConfig.Plugins.Add( 'drupalbreak' ) ;
            FCKConfig.Plugins.Add( 'drupalpagebreak' ) ;
            

   2. The second step is to add buttons to the toolbar (in the same file). 
      The button names are: DrupalBreak, DrupalPageBreak. 
      For example if you have a toolbar with an array of buttons defined as follows:

      ['Image','Flash','Table','Rule','SpecialChar']

      simply add those two buttons at the end of array:

      ['Image','Flash','Table','Rule','SpecialChar', 'DrupalBreak', 'DrupalPageBreak']

      (remember about single quotes).

Uploading images and files
--------------------------

There are three ways of uploading files: By using the built-in file browser, by using a module like IMCE or using the core upload module.

How to enable the file browser
------------------------------
The editor gives the end user the flexibility to create a custom file browser that can be integrated on it. 
The included file browser allows users to view the content of a specific directory on 
the server and add new content to that directory (create folders and upload files).

   1. To enable file browsing you need to edit the connector configuration file in your fckeditor module directory, the file should be in:

          /drupal5b/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/php/config.php
          (FCKeditor 2.5+)

          or

          /drupal5b/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/php/config.php
          and
          /drupal5b/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/upload/php/config.php
          (FCKeditor 2.3.x - 2.4.x)

      In this file(s) you will need to enable the file browser by adding one line that includes file with the special authentication function for Drupal (filemanager.config.php). Add this code:

          require_once "../../../../../filemanager.config.php";
          (FCKeditor 2.5+)

      or

          require_once "D:\\xampp\\htdocs\\drupal5b\\modules\\fckeditor\\filemanager.config.php"
          (FCKeditor 2.3.x - 2.4.x)

      straight below this line:

          $Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = '' ;

      The config.php file also holds some other important settings, please take a look at it and adjust it to your needs (optional).
      
   2. As of Drupal 5.2, additional step is required: locate file named settings.php inside 
      your drupal directory (usually sites/default/settings.php) and set $cookie_domain variable to the appropiate domain (remember to uncomment that line). If you not do this, FCKeditor will claim that file browser is disabled
   3. Enabling file uploads is a security risk. That's why you have to grant a separate permission to enable the file browser to certain groups.
   4. Lastly, adjust the File browser settings for each profile.

Modules: Image Assist
---------------------
Image Assist can be integrated with FCKeditor. 
To do this, simply copy the modules/fckeditor/img_assist_fckeditor.js file to modules/img_assist/img_assist_fckeditor.js.
