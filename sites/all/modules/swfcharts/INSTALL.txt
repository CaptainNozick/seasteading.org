swfcharts requires the XML/SWF Charts package available here:

http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/index.php?menu=Download

This module was built around XML/SWF Charts version 4.5

The files you will need are:

 - charts.swf and 
 - library dir called "charts_library"

Note: You do *not* need the charts.php script which may or may not be
included in your download.

After downloading and unpacking the library, place the 'charts' directory in a
directory accessible to the web server. Then configure the module at 
admin/settings/swfcharts
