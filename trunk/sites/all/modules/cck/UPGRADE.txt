UPDATING FROM VERSION 4.7 TO 5.x

Depending on the exact version of Drupal 5.x and CCK 4.7 you are using,
you may run into sql errors when you upgrade to Drupal 5.0. This problem
has been corrected for Drupal 5 HEAD and will be corrected for releases
after Drupal 5 Beta-2, but may still occur if you upgrade using Drupal 5
Beta-1 or Drupal 5 Beta-2. If you would like to know the details behind
this issue, read on. Otherwise, just be aware that you should use the
latest possible versions of both Drupal 5.x and CCK 5.x when you upgrade.

MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE UPDATE

The 4.7 version of the content module created a table called node_type
to track the custom node types that were created in CCK. In Drupal 5.x,
that table is created and maintained as a core file. The most recent 4.7
versions include an update to rename the content module version of this
table so that the upgrade to 5.x will be able to create it's own version
of that table.

If you are running the the most recent 4.7 content module version and have
performed all possible updates in 4.7, you should have no trouble updating
to 5.0, since that table will have been renamed and will create no conflict.
However, if your version of 4.7 is not up to date, you may still have a table
in your database called node_type. If so, and if you are using Drupal 5 Beta-1
or Drupal 5 Beta-2, you will get error messages when you update to 5.x when
the core installation tries to create that table.

The latest 5.x version of CCK will correct any errors that occur during the
core upgrade by renaming the table and rerunning the failed core updates.
However, it is recommended that you just avoid this problem altogether by
using the latest versions of all these components when you upgrade.
